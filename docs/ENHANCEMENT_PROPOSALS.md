## 1. Financial Tracking & Earnings Analytics ðŸ’°

### Current State
- No earnings data captured
- No payout projections
- No cost/revenue analysis

### Proposed Enhancements

#### 1.1 Earnings Dashboard Card
**Display Metrics:**
- **Current Month Earnings Estimate** (per satellite, aggregated)
  - Egress: $X.XX (based on traffic Ã— current rates)
  - Storage: $X.XX (requires disk usage data)
  - Repair Traffic: $X.XX
  - Audit Traffic: $X.XX
  
- **Historical Earnings Chart** (6-24 months)
  - Monthly breakdown by satellite
  - Trend analysis (growing/declining)
  - Payout prediction for current month

- **Payout Schedule Tracker**
  - Next payout date countdown
  - Expected amount per satellite
  - Historical payout accuracy score

#### 1.2 Revenue Per Operation Metrics
```
Display in satellite breakdown:
- $ per successful download
- $ per TB stored
- Effective hourly rate
- ROI trend (if costs tracked)
```

#### 1.3 Data Sources & Implementation
**Log Pattern to Extract:**
```
Current: No earnings data in logs
Needed: Query node API endpoints:
  - /api/sno/satellites (for held amounts)
  - /api/sno/estimated-payout
  - Manual: Storj pricing config (periodically updated)
```

**Implementation Approach:**
- New `financial_tracker.py` module
- Periodic API polling (every 10-15 minutes)
- Historical earnings table in database
- Pricing configuration file (manual updates when Storj changes rates)
- Calculate estimates based on: `traffic_volume Ã— pricing_rates`

**Priority:** HIGH (Most requested feature by node operators)  
**Effort:** MEDIUM (Requires new data source)

## 2. Storage Health & Capacity Management ðŸ“Š

### Current State
- No disk usage tracking

  - /api/sno (total disk space)
```

**Disk I/O Monitoring:**
```
Option 1: Parse log operation durations
  Pattern: "duration":"XXXms" in existing logs
Option 2: System metrics via psutil library
```

**Implementation Approach:**
- Poll node API for capacity data (every 5-10 minutes)
- New database table: `storage_snapshots`
  - Columns: timestamp, node_name, satellite, used_bytes, trash_bytes, free_bytes
- Calculate growth rate: linear regression on recent data points

  IF online_score < 95%: "Monitor closely"
  
Provide actionable recommendations per issue
```

#### 3.5 Data Sources & Implementation
