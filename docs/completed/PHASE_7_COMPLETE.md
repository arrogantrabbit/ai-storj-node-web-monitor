# Phase 7 Complete: Notification Channels System üéâ

**Status:** Core implementation complete  
**Date:** October 2025  
**Implementation Time:** ~2 weeks

---

## üéØ Overview

Phase 7 introduces a robust **Notification Channels System** to the Storj Node Monitor, enabling multi-channel alert delivery via email and webhooks (Discord, Slack, custom). This significantly enhances the system's ability to proactively inform node operators about critical events, ensuring timely responses and improved node health.

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 7.1 New Modules

#### `notification_handler.py` - Unified Dispatcher

**Purpose:** Acts as the central hub for all outgoing notifications, determining the appropriate channels and managing delivery.

**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ Determines which notification channels are enabled and configured.
- ‚úÖ Handles routing of alerts to `email_sender.py` and `webhook_sender.py`.
- ‚úÖ Manages concurrent delivery to multiple webhook endpoints.
- ‚úÖ Provides a unified interface for `alert_manager.py` to send notifications.

#### `email_sender.py` - Email Notifications

**Purpose:** Manages the sending of HTML-formatted email alerts.

**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ SMTP integration for various email services (e.g., Gmail, custom SMTP).
- ‚úÖ Sends rich HTML emails with alert severity styling.
- ‚úÖ Formats alert metadata into a readable email body.
- ‚úÖ Utilizes `asyncio.to_thread` for non-blocking SMTP operations.

#### `webhook_sender.py` - Webhook Notifications

**Purpose:** Handles sending structured notifications to various webhook platforms.

**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ Discord webhook integration with rich embeds (colored severity, structured fields, custom avatar).
- ‚úÖ Slack webhook integration with attachments (color coding, structured message format).
- ‚úÖ Generic custom webhook support for sending JSON payloads to any endpoint.
- ‚úÖ Concurrent delivery to multiple webhook URLs.

### 7.2 Configuration (`config.py`)

**Purpose:** Provides centralized settings for enabling and configuring notification channels.

**New Configuration Variables:**
```python
# Email
ENABLE_EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS = False
EMAIL_SMTP_SERVER = 'smtp.gmail.com'
EMAIL_SMTP_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_USERNAME = ''
EMAIL_PASSWORD = '' # Use environment variable for security
EMAIL_TO_ADDRESSES = []

# Webhooks
ENABLE_WEBHOOK_NOTIFICATIONS = False
WEBHOOK_DISCORD_URL = ''
WEBHOOK_SLACK_URL = ''
WEBHOOK_CUSTOM_URLS = []
```
- ‚úÖ `ENABLE_EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS`: Toggle email alerts on/off.
- ‚úÖ `EMAIL_SMTP_SERVER`, `EMAIL_SMTP_PORT`, `EMAIL_USE_TLS`: SMTP server details.
- ‚úÖ `EMAIL_USERNAME`, `EMAIL_PASSWORD`: Credentials for SMTP authentication (recommended to use environment variables).
- ‚úÖ `EMAIL_TO_ADDRESSES`: List of recipient email addresses.
- ‚úÖ `ENABLE_WEBHOOK_NOTIFICATIONS`: Toggle webhook alerts on/off.
- ‚úÖ `WEBHOOK_DISCORD_URL`, `WEBHOOK_SLACK_URL`: Specific URLs for Discord and Slack webhooks.
- ‚úÖ `WEBHOOK_CUSTOM_URLS`: List of generic custom webhook URLs.

### 7.3 Integration

#### `alert_manager.py` Modification

**Purpose:** The `AlertManager` now dispatches alerts to the `NotificationHandler` in addition to broadcasting via WebSockets.

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Imports `notification_handler` from `storj_monitor.notification_handler`.
- ‚úÖ Calls `notification_handler.send_notification()` for each generated alert, passing alert details and metadata.

#### `tasks.py` Modification

**Purpose:** No direct modification was needed in `tasks.py` for the core notification system, as the integration point is within `alert_manager.py` which is already managed by `alert_evaluation_task`.

## üìä Usage Examples

### Receiving Email Notifications
When an alert is triggered and email notifications are enabled, recipients will receive an HTML-formatted email with the alert type, severity, message, and detailed metadata. The email's header color will reflect the alert's severity (e.g., red for critical, orange for warning).

### Receiving Webhook Notifications
- **Discord:** Alerts appear as rich embeds in the configured Discord channel, featuring a colored sidebar indicating severity, a clear title, message, and structured fields for metadata.
- **Slack:** Alerts are sent as attachments with color coding, a clear title, message, and structured fields for metadata.
- **Custom Webhooks:** A generic JSON payload containing all alert details is sent to the specified custom URLs, allowing integration with other systems.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Sending
1. **Check `config.py`:** Ensure `ENABLE_EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS` is `True`.
2. **Verify Credentials:** Confirm `EMAIL_USERNAME` and `EMAIL_PASSWORD` are correctly set (preferably via environment variables).
3. **SMTP Server Details:** Double-check `EMAIL_SMTP_SERVER`, `EMAIL_SMTP_PORT`, and `EMAIL_USE_TLS` settings.
4. **Recipient List:** Ensure `EMAIL_TO_ADDRESSES` is not empty and contains valid email addresses.
5. **Firewall/Network:** Check if outbound SMTP traffic is blocked by a firewall.
6. **Logs:** Review `storj_monitor` logs for `SMTP error` messages from `email_sender.py`.

### Webhooks Not Delivering
1. **Check `config.py`:** Ensure `ENABLE_WEBHOOK_NOTIFICATIONS` is `True` and relevant webhook URLs (`WEBHOOK_DISCORD_URL`, `WEBHOOK_SLACK_URL`, `WEBHOOK_CUSTOM_URLS`) are correctly configured.
2. **Verify URLs:** Ensure webhook URLs are valid and accessible from the server running the monitor.
3. **Platform-Specific Issues:**
    - **Discord/Slack:** Check if the webhook URL is still active and has the necessary permissions in the respective platform.
    - **Custom:** Verify the endpoint is reachable and correctly processing the incoming JSON payload.
4. **Rate Limiting:** Some webhook providers have rate limits. While `webhook_sender.py` attempts concurrent delivery, excessive alerts might hit limits.
5. **Logs:** Review `storj_monitor` logs for `Failed to send webhook notification` messages from `webhook_sender.py`.

## üìö Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

### Phase 9: Alert Configuration UI
- [ ] Provide a user interface to configure email recipients, webhook URLs, and enable/disable notification channels directly from the dashboard.
- [ ] Implement "Test Notification" buttons for each channel to verify setup.

### Advanced Notification Features
- [ ] Notification scheduling and "quiet hours" to prevent alerts during specific times.
- [ ] Per-alert type notification preferences (e.g., only send critical audit alerts via email).
- [ ] SMS notifications integration (e.g., via Twilio).
- [ ] Notification frequency limits per channel to prevent spam.
