## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Phase 10: Advanced Reporting & Export** (1.5-2 weeks)
   - Backend report generator and CSV/PDF exports
   - Export API endpoints and streaming
   - Optional scheduled reports delivery
   - Minimal Reports UI hooks
   - Why First: High user value and requested exports

### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)
2. **Phase 11: Alert Configuration UI** (1-1.5 weeks)
   - Settings modal with thresholds and notification prefs
   - Per-node overrides and validation
   - Test notification button
   - Persistence and runtime application

### Medium Term (Next 1-2 Months)
3. **Phase 12: Mobile Optimization & PWA** (1.5-2 weeks)
   - Responsive layout and touch targets
   - PWA manifest and service worker
   - Offline caching and optional push notifications
