  - Egress: $X.XX (based on traffic Ã— current rates)
  - Storage: $X.XX (requires disk usage data)
  - Repair Traffic: $X.XX
  - Audit Traffic: $X.XX
  
- **Historical Earnings Chart** (6-24 months)

```

**Disk I/O Monitoring:**
```
Option 1: Parse log operation durations
  Pattern: "duration":"XXXms" in existing logs
Option 2: System metrics via psutil library
```

**Implementation Approach:**
- Poll node API for capacity data (every 5-10 minutes)
